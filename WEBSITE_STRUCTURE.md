## Site Structure

### 1. HOME PAGE
**Hero Section:**
- Headline: "Operational Intelligence That Takes Action"
- Subheadline: "Stop reacting to downtime. Start preventing it. We turn plant data into decision-ready actions that optimize operations, reduce costs, and keep production running."
- CTA: "See How It Works" / "Request a Demo"
- Visual: Abstract visualization of data flowing into action (plant → sensors → cloud → decisions → control)

**Problem Statement (The Challenge):**
Title: "Your Plant Data Isn't Working Hard Enough"

Three pain points with icons:
1. **Reactive, Not Proactive** - "You're analyzing what went wrong yesterday, not preventing tomorrow's downtime"
2. **Insights Without Action** - "More dashboards don't fix the plant. Decisions do."
3. **Siloed Systems** - "Data trapped across 4+ platforms. No interoperability. No unified intelligence."

**Our Approach (The Solution):**
Title: "We Build Systems That Act, Not Just Report"

Four pillars (visual journey):
1. **Sensor Integration** - Unified telemetry from any source
2. **Cloud Intelligence** - Centralized, real-time data infrastructure
3. **Predictive Analytics** - KPIs + ML models + downtime risk scoring
4. **Agentic Actions** - Automated recommendations → work orders → control decisions (with human approval)

**Value Delivered:**
"Industry-Proven Results" (with BCG citation)
- 2-5% throughput improvement
- 2-4pp margin improvement  
- Reduced unplanned downtime
- Payback in months, not years

**Who We Serve:**
- Mining operations (open pit, underground)
- Gold/copper/iron ore processing plants
- Industrial process facilities
- Any operation where downtime = lost value

**CTA Section:**
"Ready to Turn Data Into Control?"
- Primary: "Request a Demo"
- Secondary: "Learn About Our Platform"

### 2. PLATFORM PAGE
**Hero:**
"The OMNI Platform: From Sensors to Action in Four Layers"

**Layer 1: Sensor Integration**
- Connect to existing SCADA, historians, OT systems
- No rip-and-replace required
- Handle multi-vendor, multi-platform environments
- Real-time + historical data ingestion

**Layer 2: Cloud Infrastructure**
- AWS-based data warehouse
- Streaming + batch processing
- Low-cost long-term storage
- Scalable, secure, compliant

**Layer 3: Decision Intelligence**
Visual showing three capabilities:

a) **KPIs & Monitoring**
- Real-time plant performance metrics

- Shift-over-shift performance comparison
- Bottleneck identification

b) **Predictive Models**
- Downtime risk scoring (next N hours/days)

- Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation
- Maintenance window optimization

c) **Root Cause Analysis**
Answer the hard questions:
- "Why did utilization drop this shift?"
- "Which machines are the bottleneck, and why?"
- "How much time was lost to avoidable idle?"
- "What single change would have the biggest impact tomorrow?"

**Layer 4: Agentic Orchestration**
"The Intelligence Layer That Connects People + Parts + Equipment"

What it does:
- Drafts work orders automatically
- Recommends intervention windows
- Stages parts & spares proactively
- Notifies the right teams with evidence
- Integrates with ERP/CMMS/EAM systems

**Deployment Options:**
- **Human-in-the-loop** (Operator review + approve) ← Recommended starting point
- **Semi-automated** (Auto-execute low-risk actions, human approval for critical)
- **Fully automated** (For mature, trusted use cases)

**Technical Highlights:**
- Physics-constrained optimization (not just pattern matching)
- Multivariable process modeling
- Handles ground conditions, operator patterns, mechanical vs operational delays
- Built for mining's reality: imperfect data, harsh environments, 24/7 ops

"Your plant is unique. Your data is messy. Your systems don't talk to each other. We've seen it all—and we know how to make it work."

**The Challenge:**
Most plants face one or more of these barriers:
- ❌ Data isn't ingested or normalized
- ❌ Multiple platforms with zero interoperability
- ❌ 4+ systems because different machine brands don't play nice

## Design & Visual Direction

**Color Palette Ideas:**
- Primary: Deep blue (trust, tech, industrial)
- Accent: Bright cyan/teal (action, intelligence, data flow)
- Neutral: Dark grays, white
- Warning/Alert: Amber (for downtime/risk indicators)

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, technical, professional
- Data visualization elements (not just decorative)
- Industrial imagery (plants, equipment) but elevated/modern
- Abstract representations of data flow → insights → action
- Before/after comparisons (reactive vs. proactive)

**Typography:**
- Modern sans-serif for headings (geometric, clean)
- Readable serif or sans for body text
- Monospace for technical/code elements

**Key Visual Metaphors:**
1. **The 4-layer stack** (Sensors → Cloud → Analytics → Actions) - this should be a consistent visual throughout
2. **Data flowing into decisions** - animated or illustrated journey
3. **Human + AI collaboration** - not replacing people, augmenting them
4. **Before/After** - chaos/reaction vs. control/prevention
